# PCM Development Challenge for Year 3
This is the git repository for McMaster EcoCAR's EcoCAR EVC Year 3 Development Challenge. This repository consists of three branches: Main, Beginner, and Advanced. The main branch does not contain any files relevant to the dev challenge - treat it as a landing page for the repository. In this year's development challenge, it has been broken into two categories - beginner and advanced. The beginner challenge is for students in **First and Second Year ONLY**. The advanced challenge is for any level, but is recommended for third and fourth year students.
## Contact Information
While completing the development challenge, there may be times you need some support. If you are stuck, please reach out for support using the ```03 - Help``` channel of the McMaster EcoCAR Onboarding 2024 Teams server. Additional contact information is provided in either the beginner or advanced challenge outline document, depending on which you are completing.
## Getting Started
### Cloning the Repository
To complete the development challenge, create a public fork of the repository branch for the challenge you are completing. If you are unsure how to do so, please review [Github: Fork a Repository](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/fork-a-repo). Clone your forked repository to your local computer to begin working. We recommend installing Git Bash and using its command window to clone the repository. For a guide on how to clone repositories from github, please review [GitHub: Cloning a Repository](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository). It is recommended that you create a folder at the top level of your C drive called Cloned_Repos, and clone the repository within that new directory. Once cloned, ensure you are on the correct branch. To learn how to change branches, please refer to [Atlassian Git: Git Checkout](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/using-branches/git-checkout#:~:text=The%20git%20branch%20command%20can,to%20switch%20to%20that%20branch.).
### Working within the Repository Path
Once you have cloned the repository, you will want to open MATLAB R2023a, and navigate to the repository directory that is on your local machine (e.g. C:\Cloned_Repos\pcm-dev-challenge-y3). You can either use the in-window folder navigation buttons, or you can use the ```cd``` command. For a quick explanation on this, refer to [MATLAB: Changing Directories](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/cd.html).
### Adding new files to your git repository
As you complete the development challenge tasks, you may be required to create additional files. Whenever you create new files, you need to ensure you add them to the git tracking. To do so, right click the new file in the MATLAB directory explorer, hover over 'Source Control', and select 'Add to Git'. 
### Committing and Pushing your Changes to Git
As your team completes the development challenge tasks, you may need to take a break and come back to the work later. Alternatively, you may need to share your progress with a teammember so they can continue the work where needed. For this reason we are using git - it allows version control to exist, and ensures there is a cloud backup available for other teammembers to continue working from. It is highly recommended to make commits and push regularly. At the very least, you should commit and push changes any time you are stopping to take a break for an extended amount of time. For a detailed guide on how to commit and push, please refer to [Atlassian Git: Git Push](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/syncing/git-push).
### Fetching and Pulling Changes from the Remote Repository
As your team commits and pushes changes to your remote repository, you will at times need to fetch and pull changes to your local copy on your computer. For a detailed guide on how to fetch and pull, please refer to [Atlassian Git: Git Fetch](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/syncing/git-fetch) and [Atlassian Git: Git Pull](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/syncing/git-pull).
